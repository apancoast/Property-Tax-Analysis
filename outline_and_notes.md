### Background: 
Wake County is proposing a tax relief policy to help people struggling with rapidly increasing property values, especially those who are "low to moderate income homeowners". While we at Cape Fear Collective intentionally avoid advocating directly for policy, we believe that if we replicate the underlying analysis here for New Hanover County, we can well position other community advocates to pick up the torch and promote policy changes. 

### Hypothesis:
Those experience increasing cost burden housing is not equal by area, and demographics are feeling the increases differently.

### Project:
Create a one-pager containing visualizations and insights answering these questions and others as we determine in our brainstorm session:
- In which NH County neighborhoods are housing values, rents, property taxes increasing dramatically?
- Within these neighborhoods, what are the demographics and economic outcomes?
- What does an xx% increase in housing cost do to a family already at yy income level?


## My project notes
### Ideas to explore
- In which NH County neighborhoods are housing values, rents, property taxes increasing dramatically?
    - Median and mean house value by census tract in 2010 and 2019
       - Difference
       - FHFA HPI
    - Property tax difference by census tract 2010 and 2019
       - Will answer if they are uniform or how they vary. May want to gather subjective opinions if variation is found.
    - Median rent by census tract in 2010 and 2019
       - Difference
    - Average or median home age by census tract in 2010 and 2019
    - Note range values within tract and outliers of parcels
    - Shifts in ownership/rentals
- Within these neighborhoods, what are the demographics and economic outcomes?
    - Median income first and last year
        - % of those in census track living at SSS 2010 and 2019
        - Poverty level table?
    - What is median sale price / median salary?
        - Use same calc. For min/max of neighborhood or tract
        - Cost burden change within neighborhood
    - Median # of adults/childrens in a house by census tract
    - Income of those who rent vs own?
    - Race/ethnicity by percent within census tract in 2010 and 2019
    - Unemployment
- What does an xx% increase in housing cost do to a family already at yy income level?
    - Difference in dollar amount of property tax from 2010 to 2019
        - Define what percent of the median income that is for 2019/census tract
        - Amount will allow us to compare to real life examples such as “the cost of 1 month of groceries.”

- Additional
    - Utility cost table may be explored.
    - Poverty_geographic_mobility table tells me if folks are being driven out of a neighborhood.
    - area_deprivation_index_na


### Outside project scope:
- What about natural disaster damaged homes? Cost of repairs? No. of individuals displaced?
- Cost of improving older homes for aging citizens? (WARM’s work)

In Stanford professor Forrest Stuart’s book he uses a binary for his course:
- Not Gentrifiable: Census tracts had a median household income above the city-wide median household income at the start of the decade period.
- Gentrifiable: Census tracts had a median household income below the city-wide median household income at the start of the decade period.


### Major Findings Notes
Home purchasing affordability:

For NHC, the median house value was 7.8 times the median income in 2019 – 5.3 times higher than the suggested sale price/earnings ratio. Tract 110 (Greenfield St, neighborhood north of Greenfield Lake) is the only neighborhood where that ratio is under 2.5 (at 1.4). For every other neighborhood, the ratio ranges from 4.2 (Tract 112, Brooklyn and Love Grove neighborhoods) to 40.3 (Tract 119.03, surrounding the college. Low income due to college students?).

Tax burden:

In 5 neighborhoods property taxes have increase by over 50% since 2010, while earnings have only increased over 50% in one of those tracts. (Tract 102: Carolina Place, Ardmore, Manhattan neighborhoods.) The rate of property tax increase outpaces earnings increases in 18 tracts.
