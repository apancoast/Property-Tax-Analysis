# Intro to Coding with R – Property Tax Analysis  

## Overview  
This repository offers a look into my early coding journey as a data professional. In 2022, I volunteered on this project, defined by [Cape Fear Collective](https://www.capefearcollective.org/), to explore property tax changes and housing cost burdens in New Hanover County, NC, using R for data analysis and visualization.

## Important Notice  
This repository is **not** intended to be duplicated, as some external files (such as datasets and credentials) have been excluded. Instead, it serves as a reference for my early experience with R and data analysis.  

## Key Topics Covered  
- Data wrangling with `tidyverse`  
- Creating interactive visualizations with `plotly`  
- Working with geospatial data (`sf`, `ggsflabel`)  
- Analyzing income, property taxes, and cost-burdened households

## Background  
This project stemmed from a broader initiative to examine housing affordability and tax burdens. The goal was to identify trends in property tax increases and their disproportionate impact on different neighborhoods.  

## Findings
The analysis found that from 2010 to 2019, property taxes in New Hanover County rose faster than incomes, with some neighborhoods feeling the impact much more than others. It highlights the connection between rising taxes and housing cost burden, which happens when more than 30% of income goes to housing. To put this into perspective, the one-pager translates tax increases into real-life costs by comparing them to essential expenses like groceries, healthcare, and transportation.
